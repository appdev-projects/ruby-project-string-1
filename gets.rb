# Write a program that gets a name (e.g. "alice") from the user, removes
# any newline character, capitalizes it, and then says "Hello, Alice!"
# The provided code bellow begins this by storing a user's 
# provided input in the `name` variable using the `gets` method.
#
# Should work similarly to the following:
# 
#   "What's your name?"
#   hannah
#   "Hello, Hannah!"

p "What's your name?"

name = gets


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# gets.rb should output 'Hello, <entered name>!'
#
